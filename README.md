# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Viewing The Project

The project can be viewed at https://simoncarrier.github.io/sorting-visualizer/

## Project Details

This project was created with the intention of visualizing various sorting algorithms in action.
The current sorts that are available are 
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort
* Heap Sort
* Bubble Sort

I hope that this project can help other newer developers better understand sorting algorithms.

## Future Development

In the future I look forward to adding other visuals and possibly creating a pathfinding visualizer.
